# My Flask Structure Readme

## Introduction

Because I often use the flask framework to develop websites or restful apis, I built a template to speed up my work.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GundamBox/MyFlaskStruct.git

mv MyFlaskStruct YourProjectName
cd YourProjectName

sh ./build_venv.sh
# enjoy development
```
